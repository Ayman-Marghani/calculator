# Calculator

### Project Description

This is a simple calculator web application built as part of the Foundations course (JavaScript section) of The Odin Project curriculum. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes features like clearing the display, changing the sign of a number, handling decimal points, preventing division by zero, and handling overflow. The design of the calculator interface is inspired by Apple's Calculator app.

### Learned Skills

-   JavaScript programming concepts: functions, event handling, DOM manipulation
-   HTML and CSS for creating the calculator interface
-   Handling user interactions and input validation
-   Preventing common errors like division by zero and overflow
